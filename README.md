# Welcome to Remix on cloudflare workers!

I implemented the remix application as a module worker for cloudflare workers and used the durable object from remix.  
Here is an example of a simple counter implementation.  

This code has been tested on ubuntu 20.04.  

Execute the following command.  
The remix will be started locally.  

```sh
npm run dev
```
